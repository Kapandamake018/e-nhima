# eNHIMA React Prototype

This is a small React + Vite prototype extracted from the static prototype. It provides component structure, routes, and a simple Auth context to demo login state.

Getting started

1. Open a terminal and change to the `react-app` directory:

```powershell
cd c:\enhima\react-app
```

2. Install dependencies (uses npm):

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The app will start (default Vite port 5173). Open the printed URL in your browser.

Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder login with real API authentication.
- Expand pages: KYC, Make Contribution, Add Beneficiary, Manage Profile.
- Add form validation and unit tests.
